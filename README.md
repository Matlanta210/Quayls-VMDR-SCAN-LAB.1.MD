<h1>Qualys - VM - Scan 1</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
Qualys Vulnerability Management is a cloud-based service that helps organizations identify and prioritize vulnerabilities in their IT systems and applications. The service works by performing periodic scans of the organization's IT assets, such as servers, laptops, and network devices, to identify vulnerabilities.
During a scan, Qualys Vulnerability Management uses a variety of techniques to identify vulnerabilities, including network discovery, port scanning, and identifying known vulnerabilities in software and operating systems. The service also looks for misconfigurations and other potential security issues.
After the scan is complete, Qualys Vulnerability Management produces a report that lists all of the vulnerabilities that were found, along with their severity and recommendations for how to address them. This report can be used to prioritize the remediation of vulnerabilities based on their risk level, as well as to track progress over time.
Qualys Vulnerability Management also provides a range of tools and features to help organizations manage and mitigate vulnerabilities, including the ability to schedule scans, track remediation progress, and generate custom reports. In this porject I will be conducting a simple, straight forward scan.
